# stars-cmftbl-latex-package - Latex package for CMFTBL operators

## Overview

The package defines functions for rendering the temporal operators defined in
the Counting Metric First Order Temporal Logic. The package defines various
functions with variants in order to include or omit optional parameters to
the operators like the optional interval. All operators are sized to the same
width in order for them to align properly when printed one below the other.
